1. Hydration :-

In server-side rendering (SSR), hydration refers to the process of attaching event listeners and state to the HTML generated on the server, allowing the client-side JavaScript to take over and handle further interactions. This process ensures that the initial HTML rendered on the server is seamlessly hydrated by the client-side JavaScript, providing interactivity and dynamic behavior.

However, when using a modal component in an SSR environment, there can be cases where a hydration error occurs. This error typically happens when the modal component relies on client-side JavaScript to function properly but is already rendered on the server without the necessary client-side interactivity.
